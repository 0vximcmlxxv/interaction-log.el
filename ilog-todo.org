Interaction Log TODO


* TODO Sometimes, the buffer is not moved so that the last line is
  visible - see http://screencast.com/t/ZbeSM4k37i (Thanks to
  Sebastian)

* TODO Use more than one toggle command?

* TODO indent the first and second column in the log to a certain
column number, use ellipses when too long

* Get rid of setq user options buffer locally

* TODO no hscrolling in the log buffer sucks
Enable it again.  At end of `ilog-timer-function', go to the
beginning of the line (it goes to the eob at the beginning).  For
tail-mode, let whole last line count as eob.
